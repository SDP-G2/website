                <h5>User Interface Testing</h5>
                <p>Our team truly believes in giving each user a rich experience to control their Claynce robot with greater ease.
                  As accessibility and usability continue to remain as an important aspect of our project, 
                  we would like to ensure our product meets the industry standards.</p>



                <h5>Internal assessment</h5> 
                <p>
                  Our team has conducted an internal assessment to formally assess how perceivable, operable and understandable our
                  our web application is. From our sheet, our team has conducted a quantitative analysis of
                  the guidelines, where we have created a scoring guideline
                  ranging from 0 to 3 for each attribute met. We have clearly
                  identified our strengths and weaknesses to further improve
                  our user interface and ultimately the web application.
                  <br>
                  An attribute requirement is met satisfactory if its score is 2
                  or 3. 
                  <ul>
                    <li>The number of level A attributes met successfully is 10 out of 28.</li>
                    <li>The number of level AA attributes met satisfactorily is 9 out 19.</li>
                    <li>The number of level AAA attributes met expectations is 8 out of 28.</li>
                  </ul>  
                  Our team has additionally conducted a through analysis of the user interface using Google Developer Tools.
                  Testing has also been done to ensure that the font size and
                  styles remain consistent in the web application’s pages no
                  matter the device and/or browser.

                <h5>Questionnaire Overview</h5>
                <p>Our team has additionally conducted an accessibility and usability questionnaire to further understand our users better.
                   As our team’s Participant Information Sheets and consent forms met the SDP Ethics Committee’s standards, 
                   our team has proceeded to collect 30 responses from SDP students and friends. 
                  Our team believes in the integrity of input, and these individuals are useful sources, 
                  because every individual plays a key role in helping our team continuously improve our user interface.</p>

      <h4>Questionnaire Results</h4>
      <p>Conducting usability testing has allowed our team to implement
                more user-friendly features to ensure the visualizations, such as the 
                colors of the web application match properly.
                Our team has implemented dedicated features to assist end users with how the system is displayed,
                radio buttons for clear command instructions, and activity logs as a management tool for the Claynce bot.
                In addition, our team has ensured our specialized selection of visuals to ease the navigation
                "learning-curve" of the user.</p>
