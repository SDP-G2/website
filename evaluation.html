                <h5>Purpose</h5>
                <p>
                  The purpose of this test was to determine the accuracy of the primary localization system used by our robot.                </p>
                <h5>Method</h5>
                <p>
                  To determine the efficiency of ArUco localisation testing was conducted independently of other localisation methods. 50x50cm ArUco tag was put at the origin of the world, facing the y-axis. Robot facing the opposite of y-axis was put in 16,922 different positions along lines x=[-3, -2.5, -2, -1.5, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3] (all values are in meters). At each position, the distance between the actual position and the estimated position (error) was measured. The resulting error heatmap is presented below.
                </p>
                <figure>
                  <img class="centeredBlock" src="resources/imgs/aruco_qa.png" />
                </figure>
                <h5>Result Interpretation</h5>
                <p>
                  ot surprisingly, the closer robot is to the marker, the more accurate is its estimate. This has crucial importance for determining the effective range for marker detection. Technically, we could detect the marker from a big distance (e.g. 11 meters), but this test tells us that estimate based on such a marker is likely to be inaccurate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moreover, position estimates tend to be more accurate when the robot sees the marker at an angle rather than when the market is facing the camera.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This knowledge resulted in an improved design of the robot. We maximised the ArUco detection range by rotating the front cameras of the robot by 30 degrees. At the same time, we limited the detection range for the rear camera to guarantee that the estimates before entering the blind zone are accurate.

                <h4 id="subheader-title" class="text-heading title_color">Hardware-Backend Integration Tests</h4>
                <h5>Purpose</h5>
                <p>
                  The main purpose of the hardware-backend integration tests is to determine whether the robot's controller can correctly manage various states of the robot, execute (or not) commands in given states, fetch tasks from the server, and update the database with the current state of the task. It is especially important as many subsystems have to properly cooperate to carry out a specific task. What is more, robot states are more fine-grained than the state of the tasks that are store in the server, so the synchronisation between the robot and the server has to occur in a specific order and at specific phases of command execution.
                </p>
                <h5>Method</h5>
                <p>
                  Hardware modules integration has been evaluated by executing different scenarios and measuring in how many trials the system behaves as expected. The following scenarios have been tested:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Robot shuts down after it receives Abort Safety command in an idle state</li>
                  <li>Robot shuts down after it receives Abort LowBattery command in idle state</li>
                  <li>Robot executes ZigZag Task</li>
                  <li>Robot does not execute issued Circular Task while executing ZigZag Task</li>
                  <li>Robot does not shut down when it receives Abort LowBattery Command during the cleaning task</li>
                  <li>Robot shuts down when it receives Abort Safety Command during the cleaning task</li>
                  <li>Robot performs Circular task that is scheduled in the future at the appropriate time</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>Results and Interpretation</h5>
                <p>
                  We have executed each scenario 5 times with a 100% success rate. The system behaving as expected in each test case gave us confidence that the subsystems have been integrated correctly.

                <h4 id="subheader-title" class="text-heading title_color">Measuring Pattern Execution Time</h4>
                <p>
                  Measuring the actual time of the program execution turned out to be a difficult task. We had only one machine capable of running the simulation and in that machine, the simulation rate oscillated around 0.05-0.10x the actual time. Meaning that it took from 10 to 20 seconds for 1 second to pass in the simulation. For that reason, we had to make some "smart" estimates regarding the execution times of our patterns, as it was infeasible to carry out multiple trials using full setup.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We decided to measure how much time it takes to move the robot from point A on the one side of the court to point B on the other side of the court in a straight-line fashion. We compared the results for two cases:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>the robot blindly moved from A to B</li>
                  <li>the robot used our navigation module that utilises odometry and ArUco navigation</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Not surprisingly, the second case took longer than the first one. On average by 19%. There are two main reasons for that. Firstly, when using ArUco navigation there is some "jerky" motion caused by the inaccurate pose estimation making the robot adjust its pose. Secondly, due to drag and direction estimation inaccuracy. The robot does not move in a straight line, rather than a curve.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Knowing that we simulated cleaning programs without using the ArUco navigation which speeded up the simulation to bearable time. In such circumstances, we achieved the following results:
                </p>
                <table>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Pattern Type</th>
                    <th>Repetitions</th>
                    <th>(Min - Max) Running Time w/o. ArUco localization</th>
                    <th>Estimated (Min - Max) Running Time w. ArUco localization</th>
                  </tr>

                    <td>Zig-Zag</td>
                    <td>10</td>
                    <td>9m 28s - 10m 6s</td>
                    <td>11m 16s - 12m 1s</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Circular</td>
                    <td>10</td>
                    <td>23m 13s - 23m 41s</td>
                    <td>27m 38 - 28m 11s</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
                <p>
                  We find the estimated times to be within an acceptable range. Zig-Zag pattern which lasts almost 12 minutes falls a little behind the time it takes for an average person to sweep the court (from our research it is around 5 minutes per half). For the circular pattern this time is over 2 times longer, but at the same time circular traverses the same leg two times. However, due to its duration, we don't expect people to use it midgame. It would rather act as a start/end of day court maintenance program. It is important to stress the fact that the exact time results heavily depend on the configuration of the cleaning patterns. As the choice of parameters for pattern generation might differ between users.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite Claynce being slower than a human player, these 10 minutes are freed for players/court maintainers. In this time they can warm-up, stretch, rest, talk with the partner, or clean up different parts of the court.

                <p>
                  In order to evaluate Claynce performance, we had to shrink the cleaning area, so the simulations could run in a reasonable time.
                  We decided to use the robot on a area up to 3 meters away from the net, so we could also verify that changing sides of the court works as expected.

                <h5>User Interface Testing</h5>
                <p>Our team truly believes in giving each user a rich experience to control their Claynce robot with greater ease.
                  As accessibility and usability continue to remain as an important aspect of our project, 
                  we would like to ensure our product meets the industry standards.</p>

                <h5>Internal assessment</h5> 
                <p>
                  Our team has conducted an internal assessment to formally assess how perceivable, operable and understandable our
                  our web application is. From our sheet, our team has conducted a quantitative analysis of
                  the guidelines, where we have created a scoring guideline
                  ranging from 0 to 3 for each attribute met. We have clearly
                  identified our strengths and weaknesses to further improve
                  our user interface and ultimately the web application.
                  <br>
                  An attribute requirement is met satisfactory if its score is 2
                  or 3. 
                  <ul>
                    <li>The number of level A attributes met successfully is 10 out of 28.</li>
                    <li>The number of level AA attributes met satisfactorily is 9 out 19.</li>
                    <li>The number of level AAA attributes met expectations is 8 out of 28.</li>
                  </ul>  
                  Our team has additionally conducted a through analysis of the user interface using Google Developer Tools.
                  Testing has also been done to ensure that the font size and
                  styles remain consistent in the web application’s pages no
                  matter the device and/or browser.

            <h4>Evaluation</h4>		
            <p>What did you learn from your testing? How did your evaluation/user testing change your system?</p>

            <h4>Questionnaire Results</h4>
            <p>Conducting usability testing has allowed our team to implement
                      more user-friendly features to ensure the visualizations, such as the 
                      colors of the web application match properly.
                      Our team has implemented dedicated features to assist end users with how the system is displayed,
                      radio buttons for clear command instructions, and activity logs as a management tool for the Claynce bot.
                      In addition, our team has ensured our specialized selection of visuals to ease the navigation
                      "learning-curve" of the user.</p>
