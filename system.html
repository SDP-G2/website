            <h1>Concept</h1>
            <p>Many tennis courts spend thousands of pounds and hundreds of hours a year swiping their clay courts after plays. They repeat the same process often several times a day, spending extra time, which could instead be used to play more games. Sweeping the courts is repetitive, mundane and time-consuming.
Claynce is a robot that is designed specifically to solve this problem. It automatically sweeps the courts for you, and only needs to be turned on and placed at a specific point on the court! You just create a task, set a time for it, and Claynce will start sweeping - no other intervention needed!
</p>

            
            <h2><a href="#Functionality">Functionality</a></h2>
			<p><ul>
			<li><b>Selecting a pattern:</b> there are two predefined patterns that Claynce can follow when given a task. Simply select which one you prefer in the application, and our robot will do it!
</li>
<li><b>Automatic localisation:</b> Claynce uses information from the markers placed on the walls of the court to determine its position relative to the court’s centre. This allows it to accurately follow any path that is given to it.
</li>
<li><b>Returning to a specific point:</b> once the program is finished, you don’t have to worry about walking around the court and getting the robot back from different places each time. Instead, Claynce is designed to always come back to one predetermined position (at the centre of the wall, near the net) once it’s completed. It can also start from that same position, meaning that once it’s turned on and knows its position, you won’t need to move it anywhere!
</li>
<li><b>Designed to work with native and any other third-party net:</b> Claynce is a versatile robot. It usually comes with its own net for sweeping the courts; however, if you already have a net of your own, you can use that one too! Simply tell us that you don’t need a net, and then just connect yours to Claynce (instructions provided in the user guide).
</li>
			</ul></p>      
			
			<h2><a href="#Future extensions">Future extensions</a></h2>
			<p><ul>
			<li><b>Work on other types of surfaces:</b> Claynce is designed with extensions in mind, meaning that in the future it may be used to clean other courts as well as clay ones. The only things that need to be added are a mop for hard surfaces, or maybe even a sprinkler for grass courts! The robot’s net is detachable, so new cleaning supplies can just be put in the exact same place without extra work.
</li>
<li><b>Act as a general assistant:</b> our robot’s versatile navigation algorithm already allows it to travel to random predefined points on the court. So with some modifications, Claynce might be able to determine your location and come to you wherever you are! By adding some kind of holder, it would also be possible for the robot to bring something to you.
</li>
