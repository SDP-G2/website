            <h1>Welcome to Claynce </h1><br/>
            
            <p>What is one of the biggest problems with playing tennis on a clay court? 
                
            It’s the cleaning up process that comes before, during, and after your games. It’s a process that is time consuming, inefficient, and mundane.
             Therefore, we have come up with a product that will automate this process and make more time for the thing that tennis players love to do most: play the game. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Our robot, when given a task, moves around the court in a predefined pattern, sweeping it and evening out the clay surface with a net attached to the back.
