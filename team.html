            <h2><a href="#management">Team Management</a></h2>
			<p>Role distribution can be found in the table above. Each member chose their tasks themselves, meaning that everyone worked on something that they enjoyed most, or had the most experience in. Our group had three subteams, each responsible for backend, frontend, or hardware.<br>
			<b>Backend</b><br>
			This team was crucial in connecting the user interface to the robot controller. From the beginning we knew that we needed some type of link between the two sides of the project, and 
			backend allowed us to create a local server and a database to store all the robot- and user-related information for easy access and correct system behaviour. <br>
			<b>Frontend</b><br>
			The frontend team was responsible for creating a user interface that was easy to use, intuitive and accessible. They needed to make sure that a user would be able to create robot commands 
			quickly and without any difficulty, all the while keeping a consistent theme and making sure that all the created commands could be correctly sent to the server to be processed. <br>
			<b>Hardware</b><br>
			This team included both people responsible for the actual robot and environment (and their simulations in Webots), and people who created the localisation and navigation algorithms for Claynce. 
			The team had to create a design for the robot and make sure that it would still be feasible if constructed in the real world. They also found a way for the robot to be able to know its position on the court 
			and to be able to move to different points on that court in order to clean it. </p>
			
			<h4>Team communication</h4>
			Our team used two different platforms for communication. The first one was Teams, used for all official meetings and weekly Monday morning meetings with our mentor. The second 
			platform was Discord, which we used for more unofficial communication and subteam meetings, as we created several text and voice channels for each subteam. 
			<h4>Development tools and file sharing</h4>
			<p>We created an organisation on GitHub with three sections, one for each team, so that everyone could work well both individually and in those subteams. Every issue was a task from 
			the Gantt chart, and closing it meant completing that task - this way it was easy to track the subteams' progress. We chose GitHub because it also provides the ability to 
			rollback to the last stable version of the project, but, fortunately, we didn't need to use it.</p>
			<p>We also used Teams for general file sharing (like videos, demo reports, any system overviews), and Trello for task management to show any upcoming deadlines or urgent tasks.</p>
			<p>The most difficult part of using different development tools as a team was ROS. In the middle of the project we realised that the system only works correctly on Linux,
			 meaning that more work needed to be put on those people who had it installed. We managed to do it, and to even things out those members that were not directly involved in ROS took
			  up other tasks, so that everyone still contributed to the project.</p>
			  <p>In the first week of SDP we created a project plan and a Gantt chart to list out all the tasks that needed to be done. We're proud to say that we stayed true to that plan,
			   only slightly changing a few tasks by splitting them into more concrete ones.</p>
